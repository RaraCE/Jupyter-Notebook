# 🧠 Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of data science and machine learning projects! This repository is a showcase of my hands-on work, built primarily with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

Each project applies key concepts like:
- 📊 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- 🤖 Machine learning algorithms (Regression, Pipeline)
- 🔁 Monte Carlo simulations
- 📈 Predictive modeling; Model Development, Evaluation, and Refinement
- 🧬 Scientific computing
- 🧠 Neural networks and PyTorch

## 🧪 Projects Included

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Monte Carlo + Neural Net Integration** | Combines Monte Carlo sampling with a neural network surrogate to approximate integrals and compare performance. |
| **Stock Market Analysis** | Time series visualization and trend detection using pandas, matplotlib, and moving averages. |
| **House Price Prediction** | Regression model using scikit-learn to predict housing prices from various features. |
